Introduction
============

The module adc contains an abstract interface to the AVR
analogic-to-digital conversion hardware.

An inherently complex issue in the AD conversor is the reliability of
the values obtained. Such values are influenced by a number of
details: the waiting times after changing the channel or the reference
source. This module hides to some extent the procedures of channel
change or reference source change while trying to guarantee reliable
enough read values. Note that some of the factors that induce
unreliable reading come from the electrical characteristics of the
signal source being converted. These kind of factors cannot be
alleviated by the module mechanisms.



From this module standpoint, the AVR ADC services are based on:

1. A set of physical analogic channels attached to physical pins (some
   of them shared with digital ports);
2. A set of reference sources that are used to
   compare with the analogic signals beig converted.
3. A hardware that reads a physical channel, compares its value to a
   reference source and returns the corresponding digital value.

The center of this module is the adc_channel. An adc_channel is a
logical file-like object that abstracts a physical analogic channel
together with its reference source.

The functions of this module are operations on the adc_channel. A
basic use to sample N times a single channel would follow this
pattern:

.. uml::

   participant User
   participant adc
   participant adc_channel

   User ->  adc             : bind
   User <-- adc             : adc_channel

   User -> adc_channel ++      : prepare
   User <-- adc_channel

   loop for each sample
      User -> adc_channel   : start_conversion
      activate adc_channel
      User <-- adc_channel

      loop while true
         User -> adc_channel   : converting
	 User <-- adc_channel  : true or false
      end

      deactivate adc_channel
      User ->  adc_channel --  : get sample
      User <-- adc_channel     : sampled value
   end

   User ->  adc_channel !!  : unbind


   
1. Bind the logical channel to a physical channel and to a reference
   source.
2. Prepare the logical channel to be sampled.
3. Request the channel to begin a sampling.
4. When sampled: get the value obtained.
5. Unbound the channel.

Some functions are canned combinations of basic operations.


Module API
==========


Sampled values range
--------------------

The sampling values obtained are always defined between zero and this
constant:

.. doxygendefine:: ADC_MAX

Additionally, a utility macro is defined that allows to map any sample
value obtained to a given range:

.. doxygendefine:: ADC_VALUE


Reference sources
-----------------

A logical channel is bound to a specific reference source. The signal
of this logical channel will be compared to the channel reference
source to get a digital value at sampling time. Several reference
sources are available.

The "external reference source" is a mode that allows for a external
voltage source to be used as a reference. The AVR A/D conversor poses
some contraints on the use of this reference: XX The module will
enforce this constraint.

.. doxygenenum:: adc_ref
		   

Basic operations
----------------

.. doxygenfunction:: adc_bind
.. doxygenfunction:: adc_unbind
.. doxygenfunction:: adc_prepare
.. doxygenfunction:: adc_start_conversion
.. doxygenfunction:: adc_converting
.. doxygenfunction:: adc_get
		     
Canned operations
-----------------

These are utility functions that include several basic operations on a
single channel frequently used together. The aim is to simplify the
usage of this module on simple cases.

.. doxygenfunction:: adc_prepare_start

.. doxygenfunction:: adc_prep_start_get
   

Examples
========

Example 1
---------


A basic example working with a single channel. We sample four times
the channel.

.. code-block:: c

   #include <adc.h>

   int main() {
     adc_channel c;

     /* bind the logical channel channel */
     c = adc_bind(3, Int11);
     /* prepare channel `c` to be sampled */
     adc_prepare(c);
     /* start conversion on prepared channel */
     for(int i=0; i<4; ++) {
       adc_start_conversion();
       /* wait sampling and conversion ends */
       while (adc_converting());
       /* output the result */
       put(adc_get());
     }

     return 0;
   }




   
Example 2
---------

In the following example, we practice round robin sampling on two
channels. Note how the slow `put()` operation is executed while
waiting for the next conversion done. This allows for a faster
sampling rate. The example uses canned operations when possible.

The time diagram of the central part of the algorithm is as follows:

     for(;;) {
